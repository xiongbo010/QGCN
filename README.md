This repository is the official implementation of [Pseudo-Riemannian Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03134) in PyTorch, based on [HGCN](https://github.com/HazyResearch/hgcn) implementation. 

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Folder

```
The data/ folder contains all the required datasets.
The layers/ folder contains basic operations of euclidean layers, hyperbolic and pseudo-hyperbolic layers.
The manifolds/ folder contains basic operations of all manifolds.
The models/ folder contains the implementation of baselines, which consist of encoder and decoder.
The utils/ folder contains the basic utils for data/eval/train, besides, hyperbolicity is used for calculating the distribution of hyperbolicity.
